Task 1: To-do list 
Build a simple to-do list application that allows users to add,edit, and delete tasks.
You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and store the tasks in local
storage or a simplebackend server using technologies like Node.js or Flask

Task 2: Online Quiz app
Build an online quiz app with multiple-choice questions on various topics.
Users can select a quiz category, answer questions, and see their scores at the end.
Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend technology like Firebase or MongoDB
for storing quiz data and results.

Task 3: Calculator
For the task of designing a fundamental calculator using CSS, HTML, and
JavaScript, your objective involves constructing a user-engaging interface
featuring buttons tailored for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
functionalities.
Within this calculator, a screen display must be integrated to exhibit both user
inputs and resultant outputs. The arrangement of buttons should leverage the CSS
grid system for a structured layout. Employ event listeners, conditional statements
(if-else), mathematical operators, and loops to effectively manage user inputs and
execute computations.
Although this project demands a certain level of proficiency, it remains achievable
with a fundamental grasp of these technologies.
